# Alien Breed 3D II The Killing Grounds 

This repo contains a compileable version of the Alien Breed 3D II source.
It produces executables that can run the original game data or mods created with the
original/compatible tooling.

## Changes

A summary of the changes are listed below:
* Numerous bug fixes and performance improvements.
* No longer takes over the system and can exit back to Workbench.
* Fullscreen is now 320 rather than 288 pixels wide (no side borders)
* RTG cards are supported, provided there is a compatible 256-colour 320x240 or 320x256 screenmode configured.
   * AGA is still required as the menus are still rendered using the native chipset.
* Player settings and bindings are persisted on exit.
* Player statistics are persisted on exit.
   * This is primarily to support expanded modding by tracking metrics such as things killed, things collected, times killed etc.
   * For the original game, only the best level time on replaying a level is shown.

### Bugfixes

Some annoying bugs have been fixed:
* Damange is no longer inflicted by dangerous floor surfaces when not in contact.
* Liquid pools that have dangerous floor surfaces behave as if the whole volume of the pool is dangerous:
   * Flying above the pool does not result in damage.
   * Swimming in the pool does result in damage.
* Polygon rendering glitches are greatly reduced. 

### Default Input Configuration

When starting the game for the first time, the input defaults to keyboard and mouse. The controls have been modernised since the original Team17 release:
* W/A/S/D for movement and sidestep.
* C for crouch/stand.
* F to use/activate.
* Space to jump/fly.
* Left Shift to walk/run
* Left Mouse to fire

These keys, and more are remain user definable.

### Fixed Keys

Note that these keys may change in subsequent releases as various options are consolidated. The following keys are fixed and not user definable:
* Esc to exit the current level.
* F1 / F2 Adjust automap zoom.
* F3 to cycle audio options.
* F4 toggles dynamic lighting effects.
* F6 toggles wall render quality
* F7 cycles frame rate cap
* F8 toggles between full and simplified shading.
* F9 toggles pixel mode.
   * Presently this is only 1x1 or 1x2.
* F10 toggles between 2/3 and full screen size.
* Tab toggles Automap display.
* K chooses keyboard-only input.
* M chooses keyboard and mouse input.
   * Repeated selection chooses between normal and inverted mouse mode.
* J chooses joystick/joypad input.
* Numeric Pad +/- adjust vertical border size.
* Numeric Pad * exits to the desktop.
   * Note this happens whether in the game or in the menu.

When the Automap is displayed:
* Numeric Pad 5 centres on the player.
* Numeric Pad 1/2/3/4/6/7/8/9 scrolls the map in the implied direction.
* Numeric Pad . (period) toggles green/transparent overlay mode.

When the Automap is not displayed:
* Numeric Pad 7/8/9 adjust display gamma (7 decreases, 8 resets, 9 increases)
* Numeric Pad 4/5/6 adjust display contrast (4 decreases, 5 resets, 6 increases)
* Numeric Pad 1/2/3 adjust display black point (1 decreases, 2 resets, 3 increases)

All options are persisted on clean exist.
* Display options are persisted independently for AGA and RTG screenmodes.  

### Custom Options

The Custom Options menu provides the following additional options:
* Original Mouse:
   * Uses the original Team17 release mouse behaviour, with Right Mouse to move forwards.
* Always run. 

## Modding Improvements

Improvements have been made to allow modders to make more expansive changes to visuals and behaviours:

### New Features
* Each level can redefine the floor texture tile by adding a custome floortile to the level directory.
* Each level can refefine any wall texture by adding a wall_N.256wad, where N is the hex index of the slot (0-F) to override.
* A new properties file, AB3:Includes/game.props can be defined that extends over the original game link file and can add new properties:
   * Inventory carry limits (ammo, things)
   * Special ammo classes that can modify carry limits and be assigned as the ammo given by special items:
      * These make use of the 10 (alien) ammo slots that the player cannot otherwise use.
      * An example might be a bandolier that, once the player has collected an item giving this ammo, increases the amount of bullets that can be carried.
   * Achievements:
      * Achievements can be defined around:
         * Alien kill counts.
         * Group alien kill counts, i.e. any of a group of different alien types.
         * First time entering a Zone, for finding specific secrets.
         * Item collected counts
         * Level time improvements, e.g. beating a previous record.
         * Player died count.
      * Achievements can give rewards:
         * Additional ammunition, health or fuel.
         * Increase carry limits for ammunition, health or fuel.
 * Note that the binary game properties file is compiled from a JSON specification for which no native tooling yet exists.

### Bugfixes
* Doors and lifts are no longer restricted to the leftmost edge of a wall texture.


## Background

This repo is based on and still contains the original source release of TKG. The
original code is very messy, apparently containing multiple versions of the
source (the was code base handled by one man without source control).
It looks like as if TKG was grown out of the AB3D source. In fact, the original
AB3D source is contained here, albeit I couldn't get it to compile as there are
some media files missing that the executable needs.
A big difference between the AB3D and TKG code is that AB3D includes many data
files directly in the executable, while TKG is more data driven by "outsourcing"
much of its game data control into test.lnk

The way the code is "structured" is to have one main assembly source file which
includes everything else (recursivly). No makefiles or project setup is needed -
just point the assembler at the main file. There are actually many 'main' files
in the original source, pointing at different milestones, demos or renderer
experiments.

I have been able to get the code in source_4000/hires.s and
cheesesauce/cheesey.s to compile, but only the hires executable really works.
The 'distilled' version of this source is under ab3d2_source. 
Some of the older render experiments also compile, albeit rarely produce a working executable.

In order to be able to cross-compile the code via vasm I had to:

* unify filename case to lower cases and edit all include and incbin directives accordingly
* remove absolute volume names from include and incbin
* remove copy protection code/menu
* re-enable the fire effect in the main menu
* turn the default keymapping to AWSD+mouse. Make left mouse button shoot and right mouse button select next weapon


## Building
The currently maintained and buildable source code is located within the `ab3d2_source/` directory. The original game sources are retained in the `ab3d2_old_source/` directory.

A standard GNU make compatible Makefile is included. This can be used with Bebbo's cross compiler suite for Linux. See: https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc for details on installation.

There are two targets that can be built.

### Release

This is the standard game engine. When build, this produces an AmigaOS executable `hires` that can be copied to your game directory. Example for cross compiling under linux:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mheyer32/alienbreed3d2.git
... snip output ...
$ cd alienbreed3d2/ab3d2_source
$ make

vlink -b amigahunk -sc -l amiga -L /home/commander_reynolds/misc/amiga/m68k-amigaos/ndk/lib/libs hires.o -o hires

```
The optimisation level is set for 68060, however at this time there are no specific requirements for 68060, 68040 or FPU.

Please note the following limitations of the present build:

* There is no hires text mode, so level blurb is missing.
* There is no message display in game, as this used a hires slice at the foot of the view.
* There is no palette animation, e.g. pain flashes.

The game supports double buffered vertical sync and frame rate capping. Frame caps can be cycled through using the F7 key.


### Developer
The developer build includes various extras to assist debugging and feature development.
```
$ cd alienbreed3d2/ab3d2_source
$ make dev

Please note that the development build may be less stable and also slower. Features of the development build include:

* Performance metrics overlay:
    * Draw time
    * FPS (averaged over last 8 frames)
    * Object count, including breakdown in 2/3 window mode
    * Wall count, including breakdown in 2/3 window mode
    * Flat count
    * On-screen history graph for draw time and object count
* Developer toggles to enable/disable specific features statically bound to specific keys:
    * Flat shaded walls (E)
    * Shaded walls (R)
    * Basic sprites (T)
    * Glare sprites (Y)
    * Additive transparency sprites (U)
    * Lightsourced sprites (I)
    * Polygon Models (O)
    * Flats (floors/ceilings) (G)
    * Fast buffer clear (when hiding walls/floors) (Q)
    * AI attack (N)


## Considerations
Note: This section is generally always out of date as several of these improvements have been made and/or are in progress.

There are MANY ways this game can be improved:

* Use Intution for keyboard control.
* Going back to the main menu to change controls makes the level start over.
* Performance improvements (in progress).
* Quality improvements.
   * The rendering code often produces rather wobbly output.
   * Better modding support (in progress)
* More options in the game to enable/disable gouraud shading and bumpmapping as well as glare objects
   * Available in dev build.
   * Option to disable some for regular game as a possible performance improvement. 
* General code cleanups (in progress):
   * Improvements to code organisation, identifier names, etc. (in progress).
   * Refactoring:
      * Extraction of pure data from code (in progress)
      * Deduplication of common code (in progress)  
   * The current code mixes code and data willy-nilly, all in one object file.
      * Using multiple object files and XREF/XDEF may be cleaner.
      * Remove old, unused commented-out cruft (in progress).
